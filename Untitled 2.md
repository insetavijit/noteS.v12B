## 🔐 Important Fiverr Notes (Very Important)

### ❌ Do NOT name packages by features

Avoid:

- “Updates Plan”
    
- “Backup Plan”
    

### ✅ Name packages by **responsibility level**

- Essential Care
    
- Professional Care
    
- Complete Care
    

This increases trust and price tolerance.

## 🧠 Smart Fiverr Positioning Tips

- **Anchor value at PREMIUM** (most clients choose middle)
    
- Make **Maintenance feel mandatory**, not optional
    
- Use wording like:
    
    > “Recommended for business websites”
    

---

## 🚫 Scope Protection (Add to Gig FAQ)

- Maintenance does **not** include new features or redesigns
    
- Major fixes = separate custom offer
    
- One website per order
    

This prevents abuse.
