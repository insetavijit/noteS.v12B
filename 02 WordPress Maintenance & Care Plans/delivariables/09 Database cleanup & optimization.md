# **How to Approach : Database Cleanup & Optimization**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> The database is the **heart of the website**, storing content, users, settings, logs, and plugin data. Over time, it becomes cluttered with unnecessary entries such as revisions, spam comments, transients, cache junk, orphan tables, and leftover plugin data.  
> A bloated database slows down queries, increases load time, risks failures, and affects performance and backup size.

Professional maintenance involves **scheduled cleanup, optimization, indexing, and table-level health checks** to keep the site fast and stable.
