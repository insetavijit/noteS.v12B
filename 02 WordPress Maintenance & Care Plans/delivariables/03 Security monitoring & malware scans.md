# **How to Approach : Security Monitoring & Malware Scanning**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> Security is not a one-time action — it is an ongoing state of **active monitoring, detection, and response**.  
> Even with firewalls and hardening, vulnerabilities can appear through outdated plugins, weak credentials, malware injections, bot attacks, brute-force attempts, and zero-day exploits.

Professional security focuses on **continuous visibility**:

- Detect threats before they cause damage
    
- Monitor real-time activity and file changes
    
- Scan for malware and suspicious scripts
    
- Respond before downtime or reputation loss happens
    

Visibility prevents disaster.

## 🛡 **Security Monitoring Workflow**

| Stage                                 | Action                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Real-time security monitoring**  | Track logins, changes, suspicious IP activity  |
| **2. Malware scanning**               | Deep scan core, theme, plugin, uploads folders |
| **3. File integrity monitoring**      | Detect unauthorized file changes               |
| **4. Firewall protection logs**       | Track blocked attacks & bot activity           |
| **5. Vulnerability database check**   | Identify known plugin/theme risks              |
| **6. Virus/malware cleanup response** | Immediate removal & restore from backup        |
