# **How to Approach : Automated Backup Strategy & Restore Testing**

A professional backup system is not “download and store files manually”; it is an **automated scheduled strategy** with tested **restore workflows** to ensure recovery in minutes, not days.

Backups are useless **until they are restore-tested**.

## 💾 **Backup Strategy: Professional Workflow**

| Step                                            | Action                                            |
| :---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[1. Automated backup frequency]]**           | Daily full backups + weekly off-site archive      |
| **[[2. Storage in multiple locations]]**        | Local server + remote cloud + optional S3         |
| **[[3. Backup components]]**                    | Database + files + uploads + config               |
| **[[4. Version Retention Strategy]]**           | Keep last 30 days history + 3 full monthly copies |
| **[[5. Restore Testing Schedule]]**             | Monthly restore verification                      |
| **[[6. Manual Snapshot Before Major Changes]]** | Deployments, migrations, redesign                 |
