# **How to Approach : Automated Backup Strategy & Restore Testing**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> Backups are the **last line of defense** for any digital system.  
> If the website is hacked, an update breaks functionality, hosting fails, or a human error occurs — **backup + restore capability is the only guarantee of survival**.

A professional backup system is not “download and store files manually”; it is an **automated scheduled strategy** with tested **restore workflows** to ensure recovery in minutes, not days.

Backups are useless **until they are restore-tested**.

|**3. Backup components**|Database + files + uploads + config|
|**4. Version retention strategy**|Keep last 30 days history + 3 full monthly copies|
|**5. Restore testing schedule**|Monthly restore verification|
|**6. Manual snapshot before major changes**|Deployments, migrations, redesign|
