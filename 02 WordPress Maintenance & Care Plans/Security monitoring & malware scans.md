# **How to Approach : Security Monitoring & Malware Scanning**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> Security is not a one-time action — it is an ongoing state of **active monitoring, detection, and response**.  
> Even with firewalls and hardening, vulnerabilities can appear through outdated plugins, weak credentials, malware injections, bot attacks, brute-force attempts, and zero-day exploits.

Professional security focuses on **continuous visibility**:

- Detect threats before they cause damage
    
- Monitor real-time activity and file changes
    
- Scan for malware and suspicious scripts
    
- Respond before downtime or reputation loss happens
    

Visibility prevents disaster.

## 🛡 **Security Monitoring Workflow**

|Stage|Action|
|---|---|
|**1. Real-time security monitoring**|Track logins, changes, suspicious IP activity|
|**2. Malware scanning**|Deep scan core, theme, plugin, uploads folders|
|**3. File integrity monitoring**|Detect unauthorized file changes|
|**4. Firewall protection logs**|Track blocked attacks & bot activity|
|**5. Vulnerability database check**|Identify known plugin/theme risks|
|**6. Virus/malware cleanup response**|Immediate removal & restore from backup|
