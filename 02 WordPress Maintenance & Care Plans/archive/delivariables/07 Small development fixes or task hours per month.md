# **How to Approach : Small Development Fixes / Task Hours Per Month**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> A website must evolve continuously — refining features, improving UI, updating content, and adjusting functionality based on real-world usage.  
> Small incremental improvements prevent the need for costly rebuilds later.  
> A structured monthly task-hour plan provides flexibility to implement enhancements, fix bugs, add features, update sections, or support business growth without delays.

This transforms support from **reactive** to **proactive improvement engineering**.
