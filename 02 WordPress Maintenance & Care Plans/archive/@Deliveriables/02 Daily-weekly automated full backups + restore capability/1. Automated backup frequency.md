## **How to Approach: Automated Backup Frequency**

Approach this step with the understanding that **backup frequency defines your true safety margin**, not the backup tool itself. The objective is not merely to schedule backups, but to ensure that **recovery points exist at predictable intervals and are continuously maintained without human dependency**. Treat automated backups as a production-critical system: if a scheduled backup does not run, it is a silent failure until proven otherwise. Design the schedule around documented RPO requirements, validate execution regularly, and assume that **any missed or partial backup directly increases operational risk**. Automation must be observable, verifiable, and enforced by policy—not trust.

## **1.1 Define Backup Schedule**

`purpose: establish predictable recovery points aligned with RPO`

**What:**  
The employee must define and document the **automated backup cadence** (daily and weekly) based on the site’s **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** and operational risk profile. This schedule becomes the **baseline recovery guarantee** for the site and must be approved before automation is configured.

---

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Identify the site’s **acceptable data loss window (RPO)**:
    
    - Mission-critical sites → daily full backups minimum
        
    - Content-heavy sites → daily full backups + weekly archive
        
    - Low-change sites → daily full backups still required
        
2. Confirm **business and update frequency**:
    
    - How often content changes
        
    - Whether WooCommerce, forms, or user data is involved
        
3. Select the **baseline backup cadence**:
    
    - Daily full backup (mandatory)
        
    - Weekly archive snapshot (mandatory)
        
4. Verify the schedule aligns with:
    
    - Hosting resource limits
        
    - Storage availability
        
    - Restore testing capacity
        
5. Document the final schedule clearly, including:
    
    - Backup frequency
        
    - Time of execution
        
    - Archive interval
        
    - RPO rationale
        
6. Submit the schedule for **approval** before proceeding to automation setup.
    

**Training Note:**  
Do not assume one schedule fits all sites.  
A backup schedule is a **risk decision**, not a convenience setting.  
Automation must follow policy—never the other way around.

## **1.2 Configure Daily Full Backups**

`purpose: ensure a complete and current recovery point every day`

**What:**  
The employee must configure **automated daily full backups** that capture the **entire WordPress site state**, including database and all files. These backups serve as the **primary rollback mechanism** for updates, incidents, and operational errors.

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Select the **approved backup tool or hosting backup system** defined in policy.
    
2. Configure the backup to include:
    
    - WordPress database
        
    - Core files
        
    - Themes and plugins
        
    - Uploads/media directory
        
    - Critical configuration files
        
3. Set the backup to run **automatically once every 24 hours** at a low-traffic time.
    
4. Enable **full backup mode** (not incremental-only unless explicitly approved).
    
5. Execute a **manual test run** of the backup.
    
6. Verify successful completion by checking:
    
    - Backup status = success
        
    - No warnings or partial completion messages
        
7. Confirm the backup artifact exists in the expected storage location.
    

**Training Note:**  
A backup that runs daily but excludes components is **not a full backup**.  
Never assume defaults include everything—verify explicitly.

---

## **1.3 Configure Weekly Archive Snapshot**

`purpose: preserve long-term recovery points beyond daily rotation`

**What:**  
The employee must configure a **weekly archive snapshot** that is retained separately from daily backups. This snapshot protects against **delayed failures**, silent data corruption, or issues discovered weeks later.

---

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Define the **weekly archive day** (e.g., Sunday or lowest-activity day).
    
2. Configure the archive snapshot to:
    
    - Capture a full site backup
        
    - Bypass daily rotation or pruning rules
        
3. Store the archive snapshot in **long-term or secondary storage**.
    
4. Label the snapshot clearly with:
    
    - Date
        
    - “Weekly archive” identifier
        
5. Verify the snapshot is **not overwritten** by daily backups.
    
6. Confirm retention duration aligns with policy (e.g., monthly or quarterly retention).
    
7. Record successful creation of the weekly archive snapshot.
    

---

**Training Note:**  
Daily backups protect yesterday.  
Weekly archives protect against problems you discover too late.

---

## **1.4 Confirm Component Completeness**

`purpose: ensure backups are fully restorable`

**What:**  
The employee must verify that each automated backup includes **all components required to fully restore the site**. A backup missing any critical component is considered **invalid**, even if the backup job reports success.

---

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Access the most recent backup artifact.
    
2. Confirm the presence of:
    
    - WordPress database dump
        
    - Core WordPress files
        
    - Themes directory
        
    - Plugins directory
        
    - Uploads/media directory
        
    - Critical configuration files (wp-config.php, .htaccess)
        
3. Check the **backup manifest or file listing** if available.
    
4. Verify backup size is **reasonable and consistent** with prior backups.
    
5. Flag any missing or unusually small backup immediately.
    
6. Do **not** proceed until completeness is confirmed.
    

---

**Training Note:**  
A successful backup job does not guarantee a successful restore.  
Completeness is verified by inspection, not assumption.

---

## **1.5 Enable Automation**

`purpose: eliminate manual dependency and ensure consistency`

**What:**  
The employee must ensure that backups run **automatically on a fixed schedule** without requiring manual initiation. Automation guarantees consistency and prevents missed backups due to human error.

---

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Confirm backup jobs are scheduled using:
    
    - Hosting scheduler, or
        
    - Plugin automation, or
        
    - Server-level cron (if applicable)
        
2. Verify the schedule matches the **approved backup frequency policy**.
    
3. Ensure no manual confirmation or UI action is required.
    
4. Disable or remove conflicting backup schedules.
    
5. Allow the automation to run for **at least one full cycle**.
    
6. Confirm the backup executes at the expected time.
    
7. Record automation status.
    

---

**Training Note:**  
If a backup depends on someone remembering to run it, it is **not a system**—it is a risk.

---
## **1.6 Verify Backup Job Execution**

`purpose: confirm backups are actually running as scheduled`

**What:**  
The employee must perform a **quick execution check** to confirm that scheduled backups have completed successfully. This step is about **signal detection**, not deep investigation.

---

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Open the backup dashboard or hosting panel.
    
2. Check the **most recent backup status**.
    
3. Confirm:
    
    - Backup timestamp matches schedule
        
    - Status shows _completed_ or _successful_
        
4. Ensure no missed runs are visible.
    
5. Proceed only if the latest run is successful.
    

---

**Training Note:**  
This is a **daily hygiene check**, not an audit.  
If the backup did not run, stop and escalate immediately.

---

## **1.7 Review Backup Logs**

`purpose: detect silent warnings or partial failures`

**What:**  
The employee must perform a **lightweight log review** to identify warnings or anomalies that may not block backup completion but can affect restore reliability.

---

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Open the latest backup log.
    
2. Scan for:
    
    - Warnings
        
    - Skipped files
        
    - Timeout or permission messages
        
3. Confirm no “partial backup” indicators exist.
    
4. If only informational messages are present, proceed.
    
5. Escalate only if warnings or errors are detected.
    

---

**Training Note:**  
You are not debugging—only confirming **clean execution**.  
Warnings ignored today become restore failures tomorrow.

---

Understood, Boss. Below are the **final remaining steps (1.8 and 1.9)**, completed in the **same concise, low-effort execution style**, followed by **1.10 for closure**, so **STEP 1 is fully finished**.

---

## **1.8 Configure Failure Alerting**

`purpose: detect backup failures without manual checking`

**What:**  
The employee must ensure that **automatic alerts** are triggered when a backup job fails, is skipped, or does not run as scheduled.

---

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Enable notifications for:
    
    - Backup failure
        
    - Missed schedule
        
2. Configure alert destination:
    
    - Email or
        
    - Dashboard or
        
    - Messaging system (if available)
        
3. Trigger a **test failure or test alert**.
    
4. Confirm the alert is received.
    
5. Proceed only after alerting is verified.
    

---

**Training Note:**  
A backup failure you do not hear about **does not exist operationally**.  
Alerting converts silent failure into actionable signal.

---

## **1.9 Resolve Failed or Skipped Backups**

`purpose: restore backup reliability`

**What:**  
The employee must investigate and resolve any failed or skipped backup execution before considering the backup system reliable.

---

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Identify the reason for failure (permission, storage, timeout).
    
2. Apply the minimal fix required.
    
3. Re-run the backup manually.
    
4. Confirm successful completion.
    
5. Verify the next scheduled run is unaffected.
    
6. Record resolution briefly.
    

---

**Training Note:**  
Do not “watch and wait.”  
A failed backup must be **fixed immediately**, not monitored.

---

## **1.10 Record Backup Frequency Policy**

`purpose: preserve governance and auditability`

**What:**  
The employee must document the final backup frequency, rationale, and approvals to ensure consistency and audit readiness.

---

**How (Instructions for New Employees):**

1. Record:
    
    - Daily backup cadence
        
    - Weekly archive cadence
        
    - Execution time
        
    - RPO rationale
        
2. Note approval authority.
    
3. Store the policy in the designated repository.
    
4. Reference the policy in future updates or incidents.
    

---

**Training Note:**  
Undocumented systems do not scale.  
Policy turns execution into an organization-wide standard.

---

### **STEP 1 — Automated Backup Frequency: COMPLETE**

If you want, next we can move cleanly into:

- **STEP 2 — Storage in Multiple Locations**
    
- Or **STEP 5 — Restore Testing Schedule**
    

Awaiting your command, Boss.
