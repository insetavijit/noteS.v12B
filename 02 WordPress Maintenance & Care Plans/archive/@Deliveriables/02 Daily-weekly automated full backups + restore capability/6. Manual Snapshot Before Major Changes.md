**Foundational Principle:**  
Automated backups protect against routine failure; **manual snapshots protect against intentional risk**. Any major change introduces a known risk window that must be explicitly guarded.

**Theoretical Foundation:**  
Planned activities such as core updates, plugin upgrades, migrations, configuration changes, or structural refactors create **high-risk moments** where rollback must be immediate and precise. Relying solely on scheduled backups can leave gaps between the last automated run and the moment of change. A manual snapshot closes this gap by creating a **guaranteed pre-change recovery point**.

**Critical Assumption:**  
If a major change is executed without a fresh snapshot taken immediately beforehand, rollback may restore the site to an **already-altered or unstable state**. Manual snapshots must therefore be **mandatory, intentional, and verified**, not optional or implied.

## **How to Approach: Manual Snapshot Before Major Changes**

Approach this step with the mindset that **every major change is reversible by design**. The objective is not to “have a backup somewhere,” but to ensure that **a known-good state exists seconds before risk is introduced**. Treat the manual snapshot as a hard gate: no deployment, update, or migration proceeds without confirmation that the snapshot exists, is complete, and is restorable. Assume that if something goes wrong, this snapshot will be the **fastest and safest rollback path**.
