**Foundational Principle:**  
A backup is only as valuable as its **completeness**. Any missing component—database, files, uploads, or configuration—can render a restore unusable or operationally unsafe. Incomplete backups create **false confidence**, which is more dangerous than having no backup at all.

**Theoretical Foundation:**  
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) are meaningful only if **all stateful components** of the system are captured. In WordPress environments, application state is distributed across the database, file system, media uploads, and configuration layers. High-change components (e.g., databases, user uploads, transaction logs) require consistent inclusion to ensure recovery fidelity.

**Critical Assumption:**  
If any critical component is missing, corrupted, or outdated, the backup cannot reliably restore the site to a known-good state. Backup completeness must therefore be **explicitly verified and continuously monitored**, not inferred from job success status.

## **How to Approach: Backup Components**
Approach this step with the mindset that **WordPress is a composite system**, not a single data source. The objective is to ensure that **every component required to recreate the site exactly as it was** is included in each backup. Do not rely on defaults or assumptions about what a backup tool includes. Treat each component—database, core files, plugins, themes, uploads, and configuration—as independently critical. Verification must be systematic, repeatable, and capable of detecting silent omissions or truncation.
