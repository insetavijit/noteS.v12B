Monthly reporting is an **accountability loop**, not a formality. The objective is to convert ongoing maintenance, monitoring, and optimization work into **clear, measurable business insight** for the client. Every report should answer four questions unambiguously: **What was done? What improved? What risks were prevented? What comes next?** Reporting must be factual, data-backed, and consistent, turning invisible backend work into visible value and informed decision-making.
