## **High-Converting Fiverr FAQ — WordPress Maintenance & Care Plans**

---

### **Q1. What do you need from me to start?**

**Answer:**  
To begin, I’ll need WordPress admin access and hosting or FTP access (if required), along with confirmation that backups are enabled. All access details are kept strictly confidential and used only for maintenance tasks.

### **Q2. Is this a one-time service or monthly maintenance?**

**Answer:**  
This is a **monthly recurring WordPress maintenance service**. It covers ongoing preventive care, monitoring, and support throughout the selected period.

### **Q3. What exactly is included in “maintenance”?**

**Answer:**  
Maintenance includes safe updates, backups, security and uptime monitoring, performance checks, minor fixes (as per plan), and monthly reporting. It does **not** include new features, redesigns, or major development work.

### **Q4. What are “small fixes” or “limited tasks”?**

**Answer:**  
Small fixes are minor adjustments such as layout corrections, text changes, plugin settings, or small CSS/JS tweaks. They do not include custom development, feature additions, or complex bug fixes.

### **Q5. Do you support WooCommerce websites?**

**Answer:**  
Yes. WooCommerce monitoring and update handling are included **only in the PREMIUM plan**. Large stores or heavily customized setups may require a custom offer.

### **Q6. What happens if an update breaks my site?**

**Answer:**  
All updates are performed safely with backups. If an issue occurs, I restore the site from the latest backup. **Rollback and recovery handling is included in the PREMIUM plan.**

### **Q7. Can you guarantee 100% uptime or zero issues?**

**Answer:**  
No service can guarantee 100% uptime. However, proactive monitoring and fast response ensure issues are detected and handled as quickly as possible.

### **Q8. Do you offer refunds?**

**Answer:**  
Due to the nature of digital services and time-based work, **refunds are not provided once maintenance has started**. If you face any issue, I will always work to resolve it within the agreed scope.

---

### **Q9. Is hosting, domain, or email management included?**

**Answer:**  
No. This service focuses strictly on **WordPress-level maintenance**. Hosting, server configuration, domain management, and third-party email services are not included.

### **Q10. How many websites are covered in one order?**

**Answer:**  
Each order covers **one WordPress website only**. Multiple sites require separate orders or a custom offer.

### **Q11. Can I request new features or design changes?**

**Answer:**  
No. New features, redesigns, or major changes are outside maintenance scope and require a **separate custom offer**.

### **Q12. What if my site already has issues before starting?**

**Answer:**  
Pre-existing issues are not included in maintenance. If problems are found during the initial check, I will inform you and provide a custom offer if fixes are required.

### **Q13. How do you communicate during the service period?**

**Answer:**  
Communication is via Fiverr messages. **WhatsApp support is available for STANDARD and PREMIUM plans** for faster coordination.

### **Q14. Can I cancel anytime?**

**Answer:**  
Yes. You may choose not to continue after the current service period ends. There is no long-term lock-in.
