## 🔹 **Gig Description**

I will **professionally maintain, monitor, and manage your WordPress website on a monthly basis**, so you never have to worry about updates, security risks, downtime, or sudden breakages.

This service is designed for **business owners who want peace of mind**, not technical headaches.

### 🚨 **Is This You?**

- Afraid to click the **“Update”** button?
    
- Your website broke after a plugin or theme update?
    
- Worried about hacking, malware, or data loss?
    
- No reliable support when your site goes down?
    
- Want your website **handled professionally every month**?
    

👉 If yes, this service is for you.

### ✅ **What’s Included — Monthly WordPress Care**

✔ Safe WordPress core, theme & plugin updates (tested)  
✔ Automated daily or weekly full backups with restore support  
✔ Security monitoring & malware scans  
✔ Uptime monitoring with emergency response  
✔ Performance monitoring & optimization checks  
✔ Database cleanup & optimization  
✔ Broken link scan & fixes  
✔ Small fixes / limited task support (as per plan)  
✔ Priority Email / WhatsApp support  
✔ Monthly health report (updates, uptime, performance, issues)  
✔ Optional staging environment for safe update testing

> You don’t just get updates —  
> **you get someone responsible for your website.**

### 🧠 **Why This Is NOT “Just Updates”**

Anyone can click update buttons.  
Very few professionals **take responsibility when something goes wrong**.

I:

- Test updates safely before applying them
    
- Take backups before every critical change
    
- Monitor your site proactively
    
- Detect and resolve issues early
    
- Handle emergencies when they happen
    

This is **professional website care**, not a plugin bundle or automated script.

### ⚠️ **What’s Not Included (Scope Protection)**

❌ New feature development  
❌ Website redesigns  
❌ Content writing or SEO campaigns  
❌ Major custom development or complex bug fixing

(Available separately via custom offer.)

- Clear communication & transparent reporting
