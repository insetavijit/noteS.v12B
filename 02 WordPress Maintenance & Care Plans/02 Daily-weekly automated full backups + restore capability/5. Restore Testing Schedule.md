**Foundational Principle:**  
A backup that has not been restored is an **unproven assumption**, not a recovery guarantee. Restore testing is the only mechanism that converts stored data into **operational confidence**.

**Theoretical Foundation:**  
Backup systems fail most often **during restoration**, not during creation. Factors such as missing components, permission issues, version incompatibilities, and environmental drift are frequently invisible until a restore is attempted. Scheduled restore testing validates both **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** under real conditions.

**Critical Assumption:**  
If restore procedures are not exercised regularly, recovery will be slow, incomplete, or error-prone during an actual incident. Restore readiness must therefore be **continuously validated**, not trusted based on backup success alone.

## **How to Approach: Restore Testing Schedule**

Approach this step with the mindset that **restore testing is a rehearsal for failure**, not a compliance exercise. The objective is to confirm that backups can be restored **correctly, completely, and within acceptable time limits** using the same tools and access paths that would be required during a real incident. Perform restores in isolated or staging environments only, follow documented procedures exactly, and treat any failure as a system defect requiring immediate correction.
