**Foundational Principle:**  
Backup data must remain recoverable under **provider outages, regional failures, credential compromise, and operational error**. Redundancy has value only when failure modes are **independent**, not merely replicated across similar systems.

**Theoretical Foundation:**  
The **3-2-1 rule** establishes survivability by requiring:

- **3** total copies of data
    
- **2** distinct storage technologies or providers
    
- **1** copy stored off-site and geographically independent
    

Effective redundancy requires **isolation across provider, region, and access mechanisms**. Multiple backups stored within the same provider account, region, or credential boundary do **not** constitute independent recovery paths.

**Critical Assumption:**  
Storage locations that share a provider, region, or access control are likely to fail together. Redundancy must therefore be **intentionally designed, explicitly verified, and formally documented**, rather than inferred or assumed.


## **How to Approach: Storage in Multiple Locations**

Approach this step with the understanding that **storage diversity is a disaster-recovery control, not a storage optimization**. The objective is not to maintain “multiple copies,” but to ensure that **no single failure scenario can invalidate all recovery options**. Treat each storage location as eventually unreliable and design the architecture so recovery remains possible under worst-case conditions such as provider outages, account suspension, credential loss, or regional disruption. Independence must be demonstrated through configuration and validation, not assumed based on vendor claims.
