**Foundational Principle:**  
Backups are only useful if the **correct historical version** is still available when a failure is discovered. Retention strategy defines **how far back recovery is possible**, not merely how often backups are taken.

**Theoretical Foundation:**  
Not all failures are detected immediately. Configuration drift, silent data corruption, malware persistence, or logical errors may surface **days or weeks after introduction**. A layered retention strategy (short-term dense + long-term sparse) balances **storage efficiency** with **forensic and rollback capability**.

**Critical Assumption:**  
If historical backups are overwritten too aggressively, recovery options collapse to recent—but possibly already corrupted—states. Retention must therefore be **intentional, enforced, and aligned with incident discovery timelines**, not left to default pruning rules.

## **How to Approach: Version Retention Strategy**

Approach this step with the understanding that **time is a failure dimension**. The objective is not to keep “as many backups as possible,” but to retain **the right backups for the right duration**. Daily backups protect against immediate mistakes; monthly snapshots protect against delayed discovery. Retention rules must be predictable, protected from accidental deletion, and continuously enforced. Assume that when you need an older backup, it will be the **only safe one left**.

| **4.2 Define long-term snapshot count**        | Infrastructure Lead | Inability to recover from delayed failures        | Snapshot inventory review        |
| **4.3 Configure automated pruning rules**      | DevOps              | Uncontrolled storage growth or premature deletion | Pruning configuration audit      |
| **4.4 Protect critical backups from deletion** | Security            | Accidental or malicious data loss                 | Deletion protection verification |
| **4.5 Verify retention enforcement**           | Operations          | Retention rules not actually applied              | Historical backup review         |
