Broken links are **avoidable quality defects** that degrade user trust and SEO over time. The objective is to **detect broken paths early, correct intent precisely, and preserve link equity** through proper fixes and redirects. Treat link integrity as a continuous hygiene task: scan regularly, fix deliberately, validate thoroughly, and document outcomes. No fix is complete until the path resolves cleanly for users and crawlers.
