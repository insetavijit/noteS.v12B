Priority support is a **commitment system**, not a messaging channel. The objective is to ensure that every client request is **received, acknowledged, prioritized, tracked, and resolved** with clarity and accountability. Speed matters, but **structured handling, SLA discipline, and transparent communication** matter more. No request is considered handled until it is formally logged and closed.

### **[[1. Support Request Intake]]**

```
Receive request via WhatsApp or email · Validate official support channel · Capture client identity · Capture issue summary · Timestamp request
```

```

### **[[3. Priority & SLA Assignment]]**

```
Classify priority level (critical, high, normal) · Define response SLA · Define resolution window · Assign responsible handler · Mark escalation rules
```

### **[[4. Diagnosis & Resolution Execution]]**

```
Analyze reported issue · Apply fix or workaround · Escalate if required · Coordinate with backup, security, or uptime workflows · Track progress
```

### **[[5. Client Confirmation & Communication]]**

```

```

### **[[6. Documentation & Reporting]]**

```
Log resolution details · Record time spent · Classify outcome · Attach to monthly maintenance report · Identify recurring support patterns
```
