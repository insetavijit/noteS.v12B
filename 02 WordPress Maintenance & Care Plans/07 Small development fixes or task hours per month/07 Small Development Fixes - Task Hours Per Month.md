Monthly development support is a **controlled improvement system**, not ad-hoc changes. The objective is to convert small fixes, refinements, and enhancements into **continuous value delivery** without destabilizing the site. Tasks must be intentionally selected, prioritized by impact, executed safely, and documented clearly. Treat each small change as part of a long-term evolution strategy, not isolated work.

```
Apply UI or content adjustments · Implement code-level fixes (CSS/JS/PHP) · Add or refine small features · Maintain coding and design standards · Track time spent
```

### **[[4. Review & Testing]]**

```
Validate UI/UX consistency · Test functionality across devices · Check performance impact · Verify compatibility · Approve for deployment
```

### **[[5. Deployment]]**

```
Prepare deployment plan · Apply changes safely (staging or controlled push) · Clear caches if required · Verify live behavior · Confirm deployment success
```

### **[[6. Documentation & Reporting]]**
