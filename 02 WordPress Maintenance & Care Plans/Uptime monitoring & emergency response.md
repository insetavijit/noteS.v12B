# **How to Approach : Uptime Monitoring & Emergency Response**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> Uptime monitoring ensures that the website is **always available** to users and customers.  
> If the site goes down, every minute can cause **loss of revenue, damaged reputation, and poor SEO ranking**.  
> Professional uptime monitoring instantly alerts the support team the moment a failure occurs, enabling **rapid diagnosis and emergency response** before users notice.

Downtime must be **detected instantly and resolved immediately** — not discovered by the client hours later.
