## ✅ **Fiverr SEO: Title + Search Tags (Optimized for 2025)**

This is critical because **Fiverr discovery is search-driven**. Even a great gig will not sell if this part is weak.

# 🎯 Fiverr Gig Title (SEO-Optimized)

You get **one title**. It must balance:

- buyer intent
    
- Fiverr keyword matching
    
- human readability
    

### ✅ **Primary Recommended Title**

> **I will manage and maintain your WordPress website with updates, security & backups**

**Why this works**

- Starts with **“I will”** (Fiverr best practice)
    
- Contains high-volume keywords:
    
    - _manage_
        
    - _maintain_
        
    - _WordPress website_
        
    - _updates_
        
    - _security_
        
    - _backups_
        
- Sells **responsibility**, not tasks

### 🔁 Alternative Titles (A/B Test Later)

2. _I will take care of your WordPress website with ongoing maintenance_
    
3. _I will manage WordPress updates, security, backups and site health_
    

(Use only **one** at a time.)
