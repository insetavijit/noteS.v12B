## 🧠 Why This Is NOT “Just Updates”

Anyone can click update buttons.  
Very few people **take responsibility when something breaks**.

I:

- Test updates safely
    
- Take backups before changes
    
- Monitor your site proactively
    
- Fix issues before they become problems
    
- Handle emergencies when they happen
    

This is **professional website care**, not a plugin bundle.

## ⚠️ What’s NOT Included

❌ New feature development  
❌ Website redesigns  
❌ Content writing or SEO campaigns  
❌ Major custom development

(These can be added separately if needed.)
