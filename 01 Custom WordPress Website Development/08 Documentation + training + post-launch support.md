# **How to Approach : Documentation + Training + Post-Launch Support**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> A project is not complete when the website goes live — **it is complete when the client is confident, empowered, and supported with clarity**.  
> Documentation ensures **long-term maintainability**, training ensures **usability**, and post-launch support ensures **trust & reliability**.  
> Professional delivery requires a **system**, not loose files or verbal instructions.

A well-structured handover elevates credibility, reduces support load, and transforms one-time projects into **long-term partnerships and recurring revenue**.
