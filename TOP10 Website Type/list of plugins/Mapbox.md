# **How to Approach : Mapbox (Custom Map & Location Visualization Platform)**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> **Mapbox** is a **high-performance custom mapping and geolocation platform** used to display interactive maps, location pins, and property or business data with **deep design customization and fast rendering**.  
> It is widely preferred for **real estate, travel, logistics, delivery, rental, and directory websites** where map-based search and visual interaction are important.
