# **How to Approach : Disqus (Advanced Commenting & Engagement System)**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> **Disqus** is a **third-party commenting platform** that replaces the default WordPress comment system with a **modern, interactive, and moderated comment interface**.  
> It is designed to improve **discussion quality, engagement, spam prevention, social login, and analytics**, especially for **blogs, magazines, news portals, and community conversation platforms**.

Use Disqus when the website needs **high engagement commenting**, **social login**, **user discussions**, and **comment performance management** beyond the standard WordPress comment engine.
