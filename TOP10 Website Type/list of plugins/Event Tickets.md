# **How to Approach : Event Tickets (Ticketing & RSVP System for Events)**

> **Senior Developer Guidance:**  
> **Event Tickets** is a plugin built to integrate with **The Events Calendar** for selling tickets, managing RSVPs, and handling event attendee records directly inside WordPress.  
> It enables creators to **sell paid tickets via WooCommerce or accept free registrations**, generate attendee lists, and automate confirmation workflows — without needing third-party ticketing platforms.

Use Event Tickets when the project requires **event ticketing, seat reservation, attendee tracking, or RSVP management** connected to a calendar system.
